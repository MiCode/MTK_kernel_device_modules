config MTK_SDA
	bool "Mediatek System Debug Architecture"
	help
	  SDA (System Debug Architecture) is designed by Mediatek to
	  provide utilities for critical information catching and analysis.

	  This select device drivers or pure software module which control
	  or use SDA utilities. Catching data are stored in the storage
	  of devices. Mediatek in-house tools are needed for reading the
	  data and analysis result.

	tristate "MediaTek CACHE PARITY CHECK"
	help
	  This selects the device driver for the cache parity-check
	  module. The module detects errors or corrects errors of CPU
	  cache in the Mediatek SoC.

	  Enable this to get the report on detection or correction
	  of errors.

config MTK_DBGTOP

	  reserved mode (retention of DRAM after reset).
	  Provide APIs for interactions between debuggers
	  and some hardware modules.

config MTK_IRQ_DBG
	tristate "MediaTek IRQ dbg driver"
	help
	  This selects the device driver for the interrupt
	  debug module. The module provides APIs of irq debug
	  in the Mediatek SoC.

	  Enable this to get the interrupt related APIs for
	  debugging only.


config MTK_BUS_PARITY_CHECK
	tristate "MediaTek BUS PARITY CHECK"
	help
	  This selects the device driver for the bus parity-check
	  module. The module detects errors of bus in the Mediatek SoC.

	  Enable this to get the report on detection or correction
	  of errors.
