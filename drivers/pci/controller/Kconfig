	  Adds support for PCIe Gen3 MAC controller for MediaTek SoCs.
	  This PCIe controller is compatible with Gen3, Gen2 and Gen1 speed,
	  and support up to 256 MSI interrupt numbers for

	help
	  This is a temporary config used for mtk userdebug and eng load to
	  avoid Android GKI ABI rules. Once the patch be merged to ACK and
	  pull to our branch, will revert this.

	  ANDROID_FIX_PCIE_SLAVE_ERROR is the kernel config of vendor hooks.
	  Add vendor hooks for unusual abort cases to avoid system panic.
	  When PCIe encounters completion timeout, PCIe hardware will reply
	  slave error to bus, which will causes the system to panic.
