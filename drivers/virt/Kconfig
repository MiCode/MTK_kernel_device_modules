	  Say Y here to use the hypervisor-provided Virtual Machine Generation ID
	  to reseed the RNG when the VM is cloned. This is highly recommended if
	  you intend to do any rollback / cloning / snapshotting of VMs.

	  Prefer Y to M so that this protection is activated very early.

          The Freescale hypervisor management driver provides several services
	  to drivers and applications related to the Freescale hypervisor:

          1) An ioctl interface for querying and managing partitions.

          2) A file interface to reading incoming doorbells.

          3) An interrupt handler for shutting down the partition upon
	     receiving the shutdown doorbell from a manager partition.

          4) A kernel interface for receiving callbacks when a managed
	     partition shuts down.
