	bool "Watchdog Timer Support"
	help
	  If you say Y here (and to one of the following options) and create a
	  character special file /dev/watchdog with major number 10 and minor
	  number 130 using mknod ("man mknod"), you will get a watchdog, i.e.:
	  subsequently opening the file and then failing to write to it for
	  longer than 1 minute will result in rebooting the machine. This
	  could be useful for a networked machine that needs to come back
	  on-line as fast as possible after a lock-up. There's both a watchdog
	  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to
	  reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which
	  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside
	  your computer. For details, read
	  <file:Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.rst> in the kernel source.

	  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon
	  which is available from
	  <https://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/watchdog/>. This daemon
	  can also monitor NFS connections and can reboot the machine when the
	  process table is full.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  Say Y here to include support for the watchdog timer

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called mtk_wdt.
