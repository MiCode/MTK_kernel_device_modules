	  This option adds core support for Universal Serial Bus (USB).
	  You will also need drivers from the following menu to make use of it.

if USB_SUPPORT

config USB
	tristate "Support for Host-side USB"
	depends on USB_ARCH_HAS_HCD
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	select USB_COMMON
	select NLS  # for UTF-8 strings
	help
	  Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a specification for a serial bus
	  subsystem which offers higher speeds and more features than the
	  traditional PC serial port.  The bus supplies power to peripherals
	  and allows for hot swapping.  Up to 127 USB peripherals can be
	  connected to a single USB host in a tree structure.
	  
	  The USB host is the root of the tree, the peripherals are the
	  leaves and the inner nodes are special USB devices called hubs.
	  Most PCs now have USB host ports, used to connect peripherals
	  such as scanners, keyboards, mice, modems, cameras, disks,
	  flash memory, network links, and printers to the PC.

	  Say Y here if your computer has a host-side USB port and you want
	  to use USB devices.  You then need to say Y to at least one of the
	  Host Controller Driver (HCD) options below.  Choose a USB 1.1
	  controller, such as "UHCI HCD support" or "OHCI HCD support",
	  and "EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support" except for older systems that
	  do not have USB 2.0 support.  It doesn't normally hurt to select
	  them all if you are not certain.

	  If your system has a device-side USB port, used in the peripheral
	  side of the USB protocol, see the "USB Gadget" framework instead.

	  After choosing your HCD, then select drivers for the USB peripherals
	  you'll be using.  You may want to check out the information provided
	  in <file:Documentation/usb/> and especially the links given in
	  <file:Documentation/usb/usb-help.rst>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called usbcore.

config USB_PCI
	bool "PCI based USB host interface"
	depends on PCI
	default y
	help
	  Many embedded system SOCs (e.g. freescale T2080) have both
	  PCI and USB modules with the USB module directly controlled by
	  registers and having no relationship to the PCI module.

	  If you have such a device you may say N here and PCI related code
	  will not be built in the USB driver.
