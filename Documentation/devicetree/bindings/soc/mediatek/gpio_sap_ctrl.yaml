title: MediaTek GPIO Controller For Aligning State Of sAP

description: |
  The GPIO Controller For Aligning State Of sAP (gpio_sap_ctrl) is used to
  control our gpio state in response for algining the state on sAP. In the case
  of host controlling slave power, there might be a path from some host pin with
  non-zero voltage to unpower slave and finally to another host pin. In this
  case, the pins might be in something like 50% high voltage, which is invalid
  in such digital pins.
